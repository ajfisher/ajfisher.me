Considering it's the end of 2025 and chrome is now 17 years old, it's mind
blowing to think that Split View for tabs was only just added as a feature.

One can't help but wonder if a lot of the chrome devs are forever messing with
windows to have a google doc / email and a chat bot open side by side and
decided to make copy-pasting that much easier.

There are so many scenarios I do this besides just working with AI. Notably
when I'm taking notes while talking with someone in Google Meet or just now
having Xero and my bank website open side by side to pay some invoices.

This is agreat feature that really should have been available when we first
got tabbed browsers over a decade ago.
