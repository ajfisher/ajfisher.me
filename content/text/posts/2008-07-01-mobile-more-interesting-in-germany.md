Here's one for anyone that really wants to be "chipped" but is still waiting
for the technology to mature.

Germany just opened a new supermarket called the "Future Store" showcasing
some retail technology we may start to see filter into standard supermarkets
around the world over the coming decade.

Some of it is a little Jetsons-esque (and cute) like the robot telling you
about all the cool stuff, however the key enabling technology is the mobile phone.

Shoppers can install an app on their phone, allowing them to
"scan" products as they put them in their trolley. When you are ready to
checkout, you hit a button in the app which then creates a single
barcode for the final value which you scan at a self-service terminal. You then
pay in a standard manner and wander out of the shop.

Most brilliant about this mechanism is it doesn't try to take any of the pieces
out of the process - all the phone is doing is acting as a calculator and then
passes the total to the till. This leverages approaches we already use for
things like deli goods where a unique barcode is generated just for that purchase.

This keeps the whole system very simple but will
save a huge amount of time when doing the shopping and won't be scary for the
shoppers. Once customers are happy with the behaviour you can start giving them
more features to play with like actually paying for it off their mobile (or
chip in their hand!) as they are putting their groceries in their basket.
