[Corridor Digital](https://www.corridordigital.com/) have just delivered a
wonderful demonstration of a breakthrough workflow using generative AI to
amplify the talents of a very human VFX team. This is creators and AI working
together to produce excellent results.

The final video is below:

My general view on tech is that at its best, technology has the power to unlock
human creativity and empower people through its use.

This position often takes a pummelling due to malignant actors, the
(dis)incentives of ad-driven monetisation and, the power imbalance of late-stage
capitalism on the communities they "serve".

While some people on the internet have been living out their teenage fantasies
on [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home) or conceiving of ways to
spam publishers with ChatGPT, the folks at corridor digital have used generative
AI to augment a video production workflow. The results, as you can see in the
video, are impressive.

As this technology gets into more diverse hands, the ability of people to tell
their own stories becomes more democratised. Yes, you still need access to
a powerful workstation, a green screen, a studio space and recording equipment.
However, the costs of these are constantly dropping, and the ability to achieve
these results without complex motion capture set ups drops the cost of production
significantly.

One can see a future (when second or third generation chips are optimised for
this type of computation) where the ability to do this type of production
becomes as common as an app on an iPhone. This would mirror the trajectory we
have seen with image stabilisation and computational photography over the last
decade. Technology and humans working together in concert allows for more
creativity without a big budget which drives further innovation and experimental
uses.

If you want to see the how to video and the workflow corridor digital have used
here, there's a making of video which you wan check out below.
