Having an afternoon cup of tea and playing with [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com)
has become my new ["Wordle"](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)
style activity.

In particulary, getting it to explain relatively complex things using style
transfer can generate some quite amusing and interesting results. The image

[Haikus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku).

This shows that the model can be steered with constraints very effectively
which should prove advantageous for things like learning or other scenarios
where you want to take some information and distil it into a very specific form.
