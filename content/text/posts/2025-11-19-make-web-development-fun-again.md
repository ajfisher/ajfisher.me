Something I've been thinking a lot about recently is how web dev is decidedly
un-fun now. Sure I can produce things a hundred (probably a thousand) times
faster than when I started as an engineer and the benefit of that is that my
output higher and to a much higher quality level.

But as we've made web dev (and really all software engineering) codified,
industrialised and KPI driven we've beaten all risk and interest out of it into
some kind of greige experience.

React is just COBOL with JSX...

People complain about the AI slop. AI isn't the cause of the slop, it's the
methods we use to incentivise what is produced, and those methods were already
creating "human slop" long before ChatGPT.  Heaven help me to look at another
website made with tailwind (or Bootstrap before that) or using the material
design system.

That process just got supercharged by AI coding tools.

I have a whole perspective on why I think this has occurred due to the
corporatisation of the web but I'll leave that for another day.

In the mean time, do me a favour. Use your AI assistant and go make the most stupid,
wacky, off the wall thing you can imagine, then ping me about what you did with
it - publicly or privately either way. It doesn't have to be good or generate a
million likes or be monetisable.

Just go and make something because you find it fun.
