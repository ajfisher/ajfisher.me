Dating company Snack has launched a [new
feature](https://ispr.info/2023/03/24/gen-z-dating-app-snack-lets-your-ai-trained-avatar-go-on-dates-so-you-dont-have-to/)
that allows users to construct avatars and allow them to go on virtual dates
with each other. When I say "dates", I really mean both sides show some level
of interest and then the avatars have a bit of a chat with each other to exchange
more information.

Snack initially made waves a couple of years ago when they implemented an
algorithm that would penalise ghosters by turning that person invisible and
unable to be matched. So they have form in trying out new things.

Boomers and Gen-Xs who only dated in a physical context and were also very
limited in terms of the pool of people that may be available - will find this
especially disconcerting and "weird". These are the same cohort couldn't fathom
why someone would date using tinder when you could just "go out and meet
someone". Not really understanding the issues of geography, contemporality,
demographic shifts, reduction in third spaces and safety concerns that younger,
urban generations find themselves in compared to earlier ones.

I can see people complaining about how Gen-Z lack spontenaeity, that they are
disconnected from people and only living in the digital realm  - especially
as more of these tools start to surface. However, I think this neatly
illustrates the convergence of numerous technologies and use cases. It's just
that Snack have realised where the puck is heading and got there first.

While there's a little bit of AI-gimmickry occurring here with Snack (which I
am sure won't harm their valuation), it's another data point in a landscape that
is increasingly digitising ourselves or using AI bots to do work when we are
otherwise engaged. These include the use of AI for things like real time call
screening (already available on all high end Android phones), credible email
responses (see Bing and Google launches in this space this week) and even
personality doubles (eg Replika).

A digital twin (or many digital twins) operating in constrained domains such as
pre-date screening, interviews, applications for standardised services (eg home
loans) or even negotiating for you based on a set of criteria are potential
areas that are yet to be explored. With technologies like this starting to be
tested, I feel like I'm not that far from being able to "brief" my digital twin
to go and arrange me a two week holiday in Japan and feel confident it's going
to do a pretty good job at it.

I'll be fascinated to see where this heads. Whether Snack survives or not is
really beside the point. What we're about to bear witness to is how AI
and digitisation technologies will influence the dating behaviour of a whole
generation who have become adults during a backlash against algorithms but also
genuinely useful AI assistants.
