The latest retail trade figures are out and revenues are “fine” - suggesting a
relative return to normalcy. Retail businesses are selling products and
customers are buying them, so that's the good news. The "when?", and the "for how
much?" is the more interesting question.

I’ve spoken to a lot of retailers in the lead up to Christmas and New Year and
the vast majority of senior retail people I talk to have noted that sales got
dragged forward even more than in previous years. [Click
Frenzy](https://www.clickfrenzy.com.au/), [Black
Friday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Friday_(shopping)),
[Singles' Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singles%27_Day) are not new
things to Australia but this year seems to have accelerated the behavioural
shift of consumers doing more of their festive shopping in heavy sales periods.

As consumers, it seems we’re less about nabbing ourselves a bargain on Boxing
Day and more about getting our festive purchasing done in November without
breaking the bank. [Greg Jericho at the
Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2024/jan/11/retail-spending-figures-australia-reserve-bank-rba-interest-rates-announcement)
has a pretty good breakdown of this behaviour and highlights the impact of sales
moving from December into November.

The sting in the tail of all this is retailer profitability. If everyone is
fighting for the same pool of money from consumers using deep discounts, getting
those sales is eroding margin. This is at a time when non-grocery retailers
are operating on slimmer margins than pre-pandemic.

For the retailers I work with, these are some of the things I’m advising, now
we’re into January:

## 1. Discount analysis

Look at your sales from October to December and do an analysis of
discounting on those sales and as much as possible, track this back to
realised margin.

You might need to make some assumptions, but a friendly analyst in your finance
team can help here with building a model that will be good enough to make
decisions.

## 2. 2024 scenario planning

Look at your 2024 plan and assume your revenue occurs on the same pattern,
and plan for more sales pulling from December into November.

What can you do to protect that margin in other parts of the year to give you
space in November? Are you doing discounts in September or October where you
no longer need to?

## 3. Reconsider value mechanics

Have you got time to think of other mechanics you can bring to market to
provide value to customers during this sale period, without having to
discount deeply?

Good examples are product bundles (smaller unit discounts with higher ATV),
gifts with purchase or sampling that may drive future sales into the new year.

## 4. Be selective with offers

Consider offers for longer term customers that reward tenure during sales
periods and go less hard on the blanket discounts.

Have one or two share-worthy offers so you’re present in the melee of the sales
frenzy and give people a reason to take a look, but use these to drive customer
acquisition and have dedicated acquisition onboarding journeys.

*Make the most of discount and non discount periods - (ajfisher / Gemini)*

With the quarter finished and before getting stuck into the next round of
product launches, seasonal drops and new initiatives - now is the time to take
stock. It’s important to consider how these behavioural patterns are getting
baked in and building next festive plans around them as this behaviour won’t be
going away any time soon.
