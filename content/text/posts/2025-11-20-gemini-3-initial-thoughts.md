I have no idea what Google did in the jump from Gemini 2.5 to 3, but
responses are significantly tighter and the tone is way more consistent across
a long, mulit-turn sessions.

One of my observations with [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com) in the past is
that a single response could often feel like 2 or 3 different conversations
jammed into one, and it definitely jumped around between responses quite a bit
too. Using it often felt like it was trying to impress you with how much it
could do, but didn't care much about how the five things it was recommending
were synthesised back in a way that was cohesive.

It now seems far more likely to drop in contextually relevant non-generated
images with references (no doubt leveraging their huge search assets) which is
a welcome addition to simply dumping link refs. Even adding links feels more
consistently applied and useful.

Apparently, it still can't make images that aren't square - which is deeply
annoying. Though as an improvement you can get letterboxed images now rather than
it simply cropping off the content like it did previously.

An alternative hack is to upload a blank image (yes literally just a white or
transparent rectangle) that is the aspect ratio you're after and it will then
"edit" your source image with the generated content. Here's hoping they fix
that soon.
