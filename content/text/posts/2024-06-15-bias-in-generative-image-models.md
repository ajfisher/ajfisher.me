It's well known that GenAI has some serious biases in it, particularly for
image generation. I'm currently producing images to include in a talk I'm
doing, and without some significant prompt pushing, you're way more likely to
produce images of fellas with red hair than you are a person of colour.

The hoops you need to jump through to get a person who is obviously above the
age of 50 is pretty astonishing too. Although if you ask for an image of a
CEO, you'll pretty reliably get an older looking man in a nice suit as can be
seen below.

*Prompt for an image of a CEO presenting to a board and you'll frequently get
something like this*

Without steering, this amazingly added women to the boardroom, although they are
all white. I also have a sneaking suspicion that the lady on the right with
what looks like red hair is supposed to be blonde and the colour grading
pulled it towards red.

There's nothing new here that hasn't been said a thousand times already but
having to push the systems so hard to get some diversity means that lots of
people won't bother and will just use what's served up to them which
reinforces entrenched biases.

This said, I'm sure the redheads out there will be pleased for some extra
representation in my talk.
