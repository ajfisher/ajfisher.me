After a day experimenting with [Atlas](https://chatgpt.com/atlas/), I still
find the idea of an AI browser (and not just an AI-enhanced context
menu *inside* a browser) a bit odd.

Using it also made me reflect on the bafflingly useless AI integrations in
all the incumbent browsers (notably Chrome / Edge / Safari) - even though they
could embed their own first-party AI (Gemini / Copilot / Siri 😅) with ease.

This contrast provides a glimpse into the underlying product strategies of MS &
Google (and to a lesser extent Apple) versus [OpenAI](https://openai.com) and
[Anthropic](https://anthropic.com) the cultural beliefs shaping those strategies.

Google and Microsoft inherently believe they are the centre of your digital
universe. This is because they own your email and core productivity tools
(especially in a work / enterprise context) and in many cases, your device via
Android and Windows which reinforces this belief.

Their ecosystems are designed for inward integration, not outward
collaboration. They provide APIs for others to plug *into* them - but rarely
integrate back outwards to others.

By contrast, <b>OpenAI and Anthropic take a connective-tissue approach</b> — through
skills, connectors, and APIs that interoperate with tools like M365, Google
Workspace, Notion, and more.

They have no choice, as they can't build the rest of the enterprise stack
fast enough. But, it also makes great business sense because it allows them to
leverage existing ecosystems and enable a lot of use cases it would take them
years / decades to otherwise realise and keep their resources focussed on their
core product.

We're watching two very different philosophies play out in market and it's not
clear who wins here.

Can Anthropic / Open AI create enough of an ecosystem and creates enough value
via leverage that their tooling "is just better" than the offering from
MS & Google? It's too early to tell at this point.

Open AI releasing Atlas might be a warning shot to MS and Google. Or it might be
a distraction as the value emerges from other parts of the ecosystem (eg agents
behind the scenes). Either way, it's interesting to see the strategies
manifest in new products at extreme pace.
