    DVD Jon's latest hack targets iTunes lock-in and revives the argument that
    purchased media should be playable anywhere.

[DVD Jon or Jon Lech Johansen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Lech_Johansen)
as he is more commonly known gets a lot of love here. This great Norwegian
famously broke the DVD encryption put in place by the big firms with the
release of some software primarily aimed at allowing DVDs to be played on
computers and unlocking the regionality of DVDs and DVD players.

When he released DeCSS he ran afoul of the [US
DMCA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMCA) and was almost charged, he was then
indicted by Norwegian authorities acting on behalf of the US who actually did
go to court twice to try and convict him of hacking. Both times they failed and
decided not to go to the Supreme Court.

Imagine our complete amusement in the office when we find out he's now trying
it on with Apple via iTunes.

iTunes is a love it or hate it product - if you are part of the Apple / Steve
Jobs faithful it is obviously the greatest thing on earth, if you know nothing
about technology it's a simple product that allows you to use one of those
"fangled new digital music type thingies".

If you are a techie you see it as a proprietary lock in and try and avoid it
like the plague. The main issue for most techies is you can't play your music
on anything other than your PC / Mac that has iTunes installed and your iPod /
iPhone / iTouch.

I've [railed against lock in](/2007/05/03/drmed-for-life/) for time immemorial -
just a quick count of my personal items puts the following music players at
my disposal - mobile phone (x2 because my wife has one that can play music
too), MP3 capable stereo, PC (x3 - my office, my home and laptop), PSP, Xbox, a
real MP3 player and my Nokia Internet Tablet - 10 devices at my personal
disposal that I want to play music from and indeed do play music from.

The thing is, I know how to do all of this so I just push the files around on
memory cards or over my network (streaming from my media server for example)
onto the various devices. For many people this isn't possible and Apple's
enforcement of the iTunes lock ins firmly violate the right I have to play my
music (or video) on whatever device I choose at whatever time I choose. I also
vote with my wallet and don't buy tunes from Apple.

What DVD Jon has done with his software (available from
[DoubleTwist](http://www.doubletwistventures.com/dt/Home/Index.dt) for free) is
allow you to take files that are locked into iTunes and essentially it plays
the file, re-encoding it into a format you can play on other devices (I haven't
looked properly but presumably OGG or MP3).

Just to rub salt into the wound he's going to cause Apple and the US music
industry, he's decided to let you share your files with friends as well. One
wonders how long it will be before a writ arrive from the RIAA and Apple... I'm
sure they'll be racing to get in first.

So well done Jon - keep up the good work and keep fighting the good fight -
media we have legitimately purchased is ours to use on any device we own for
our personal use.

Eventually the media industry will wake up and realise where they've been going
wrong. Perhaps if EMI had taken notice of the way the world was going they
wouldn't have had to cull a couple of thousand staff.
