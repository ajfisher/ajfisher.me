The music is stopping and more or less the last of the big IT players have now
developed or bought cloud computing services. Sun has announced this week
that it is [purchasing Belgium company
QLayer](http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/pr/2009-01/sunflash.20090107.1.xml).
While Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle and IBM have gone rapidly into Cloud
services, Sun Microsystems have been conspicuous by their absence in the
cloud scene over the last 12 months. Now we know why, as they've been on the
buy rather than build path.

Interestingly, this direction for Sun won't set them on a path to square up
against Google, Amazon and Microsoft but rather see them develop a tool chain
and service that will focus more on the management of cloud services with
more of a focus on private clouds. This ground is relatively fallow in the
Cloud Computing world as most of the focus has been on commodifying services
for the the Internet - a la EC2 and AppEngine.

This approach by Sun will allow corporate data centres to use virtualisation to
reconfigure system resources as required. This is important for large,
geographically spread out businesses, with changing patterns of usage as
different business units and regions go on and off line while minimising the
level of investment in physical hardware and keeping things more secure than on
a public cloud.

If we thought 2008 was the year of the cloud (not least after Werner Vogels -
Amazon's CTO - won Information Week's Chief of the Year award) we probably
haven't even started yet with more players and services popping up and planned
into 2009 and 2010.
