As bloggers are generally quite anonymous I think we should disclose any of our
interests that may be pertinent to the writing and publishing of a story -
so here's everything relevant about me.

## Disclaimer

I am one of several LoyPal and Rocket Melbourne employees that answer questions
and write online and in the wider media and this extends to speaking engagements.
I am usually communicating about Physical Computing, Open Source Software,
Mobile technology and the future of Internet and Retail related technology so
in these areas I generally make some sort of sense.

If I publish something here that is of use to you then that's fantastic (and
I'd love to hear of your success) but at it's heart this is my personal blog;
the views or opinions expressed here are mine alone and do not constitute the
views of my employer.

I reserve the right categorically to say something stupid ;)

## Disclosure

I am the founder of Rocket Melbourne where I
draw a salary. In addition, I am a co-founder and CTO of LoyPal where I have
equity interests and draw income.

I don't accept speaking fees, consulting fees, honoraria, or junkets. I don't
accept free, discounted, or loaned products. When I receive unsolicited gifts
of value from companies or individuals in the scope of work, I give away those gifts.

When I speak at a conference or event I generally do not pay a registration fee
for that event. Most conferences also either waive or discount fees for that event
so that my colleagues or clients may attend as well. Generally either I, or my
company pay for travel and accommodation expenses when I speak, however living in
Australia means some conference organisers will cover my travel costs to get me
somewhere (as Melbourne is a long way from anywhere).

I do not run advertisements or otherwise receive any monetary compensation
from the operation of this website. 

The costs of hosting and operating ajfisher.me are covered by Rocket Melbourne
for my ongoing contibution to open source projects and open communities.

I have shares in [LoyPal](https://loypal.io) that were granted to me as
compensation for providing advisory services. I still provide those services.

I have been granted investments in Yahoo that were provided for services in
community building.

I have investments in [ClearVue technologies](http://www.clearvuepv.com/) that
were purchased by me as I think their tech is interesting and may help our future
power needs for buildings.
