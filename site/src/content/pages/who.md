If you're interested, here's a bit more about me.

## My job

I am the founder of technology research lab and consultancy, Rocket Melbourne.
Here, I get to explore some of the future ways in which Internet technologies and
individuals overlap and get to spend my time peering into the future as well
as creating a very small part of it as well. Most of my work with clients is
focussed on how they deliver incredible customer experiences by leveraging
design, technology and data into a cohesive whole that lives up to customer
and brand expectations.

Up until recently I was the Global Director of Technology for Aesop, a large,
international cosmetics retail business that was bought by L'Oreal for $3.7Bn
in 2023. Working at this business for 7 years was an immense privilege given
its strong brand and commitment to ethics.

Finally, I am the Co-Founder and Chief Product and Technology Officer for LoyPal,
an Australian digital startup focussing on customer growth for marketing and
customer teams for direct to consumer brands using advanced data processing
capabilities. This team is some of the best I've ever had the privilege to work
with and the product being built is transforming client businesses. 

## My projects

I have always contributed to Open Source communities and projects, though
more recently I've tended to focus on areas that are pushing at the boundaries
of physical computing and web technologies.

#### NodeBots - Johnny Five

I am a core team member of the NodeBots group, where we help design ways for
JavaScript to be able to work with physical hardware more effectively. The
main output of this work is the [Johnny Five project](https://johnny-five.io) -
a JavaScript library that allows developers the means to rapidly integrate
hardware with web technologies.

#### Interchange

Interchange provides the ability to extremely rapidly flash and configure
physical hardware with known firmware. This is designed to be able to get
developers to use compenentised hardware more effectively rather than reinventing
the wheel for hardware projects. I was the creator and am lead maintainer of the
project that continues to see active development and provide utility to the
wider NodeBots community.

The package itself is at [NPM](https://npmjs.org/nodebots-interchange) and to
find out more you can read the [post I wrote about it](/2016/01/26/road-to-interchange).

#### Node Pixel

The Node Pixel project provides a common interface to LED "pixels" such that they
can be interacted with from NodeJS quickly and intuitively. I was the original
creator and continue to be lead maintainer of the project.

You can see more about the library at [GitHub](https://github.com/ajfisher/node-pixel).

## My history

I have been interested in technology as long as I can remember. I started
programming as a kid and never stopped (and that's a few decades ago now).
I've worked for digital agencies and for various clients since the dawn of the
web (in spite of University professors telling me it would never take off) and
had the pleasure and privilege to work with amazing people and develop some
fantastic applications and services that have lead to the growth of our great
medium across the retail, music, leisure, government and finance industries.

## My Communities

I am part of several online and physical communities.

* [Connected Community HackerSpace](https://hackmelbourne.org) - The original
    HackerSpace / MakerSpace in Melbourne where I'm a member as well as run regular
    workshops.
* NodeBots AU - A [slack](https://invite.nodebotsau.io) and [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Melbourne-NodeBots-Nights/)
    community that looks at ways to bring the web and physical computing together

#### My networks

I don't use Facebook, I use [Twitter](http://twitter.com/ajfisher) as well
as [Instagram](https://instagram.com/andrewjfisher) to answer messages. You can
connect on [LinkedIn](http://au.linkedin.com/in/andrewfisher) and
[Google](http://www.google.com/profiles/ajfisher.td) as well.

## My opinions

That's pretty much what this blog is about but in a nutshell here's what you
get from me.

The state of and future of the Internet and the Web, lots to do
about mobile technology and in particular how the mobile Internet changes our
lives and the way we interact with the web. You'll see some rants about why
certain things haven't been implemented well, but always with a recommendation
for how they should be in order to spark debate.

I also talk a lot about Open Source Software (having been a Linux user since
the 90s and a Unix user before then), Cloud Technologies (one of the most
disruptive shifts for business since the Internet) and Physical Computing /
Ubicomp (where the web meets the physical world).

## My future

I love technology, I live it in every part of my life. I am always looking at
new ways technology can be used to enhance our existence and to empower people
and businesses to reach their potential. I can't see a time when I'm not
guiding or developing technology to take us somewhere so, if you're doing
something interesting let me know.

## Contact

The best way to contact me is good old fashioned email. I'm ajfisher.td [at] gmail

Failing that @ajfisher me on twitter will usually get a response too.
