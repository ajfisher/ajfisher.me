    IoT product development has the opportunity to draw on some of the lessons

I got the opportunity to write an opinion piece for [IBM Developer Works](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks)
on what lessons from other aspects of technology could be applied to IoT. I
drew from my own experience in mobile, looking at:

* how decoupling services from avatars create more natural interaction methods
* assuming connectivity issues and adopting an offline first approach
* How the hardware & software design process unfolds as a result of interaction
refinement.

> This challenge is magnified when you consider the numerous contexts in which
your IoT product might be used. It might just be a sensor, but how do you
interact with it? Is it by using a mobile or web application? Is configuration
different than reporting? How usable are these interfaces? The list of
questions can seem endless.
