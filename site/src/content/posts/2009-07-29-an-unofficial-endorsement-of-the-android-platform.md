As [TechCrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/) reported: [Pigs Fly as Facebook and Google work together on an Android  App](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/28/pigs-fly-as-facebook-and-google-work-together-on-an-android-app/) - there's been a few indicators that this might be  happening, particularly with some random mentions here and there on [Twitter](http://search.twitter.com/search?max_id=2901309107&page=15&q=android+facebook) but no one was really expecting anything to occur given the competitiveness between the two businesses.

What's most interesting about this (particularly from my standpoint as an [Android ](http://www.android.com/)user) is  that it will be the only other official mobile client besides [iPhone](http://www.iphone.com/); which  really endorses the Android platform as the second runner to iPhone. And in  acknowledging that, it also indicates that [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/) are considering that Android will have substantial traction in the coming year - not least when you consider there are two dozen Android based phones [slated to hit the market in the rest of  the year](http://www.google.com.au/search?q=new+android+phones+2009&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a) which could make a serious dent in iPhone's penetration.

iPhone  launching with the Facebook client has been largely cited as one of the big  levers in it's sales. Smart phones have been around for a decade and there  have been sleek devices previously ([Nokia 7710](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_7710) for example was just one big  touch screen 3 years before the iPhone launched) but the mind of the consumer  wasn't fired by the opportunities it could provide to them. You only had to look  at the marketing by the telco's around the iPhone launch to see that the  Facebook client was the Killer App for the smart phone in terms of hooking people  in. It gave them a very tangible benefit to owning what would have been the most  expensive handset they'd have bought to date - "I can keep in touch with my  friends besides calling them..."

With an official Facebook client for Android, the same endorsement has been conferred and one  of the key marketing differentiators has been removed. I'm tipping late 2010 to  be an interesting time as Apple and Google really go toe to toe and start  slugging it out - which will be fantastic for innovation in this  space.
