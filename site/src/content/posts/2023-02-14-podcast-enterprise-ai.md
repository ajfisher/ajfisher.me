I was invited to sit down with some other technology leaders for a podcast
where we discussed Generative AI and the Enterprise.

Given how rapidly it has become the only thing everyone is talking about, we
started with the emergence of [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and its use
in a business context.

Very quickly we moved on to discuss the implications of Generative AI from a
regulatory perspective - especially if you work in heavily regulated industries
such as Finance or Health - as well as philosophical considerations such as
what is the value of huamn work and creativity.

One of the areas we go into much more depth and is particularly applicable to
business use is the notion of Generative AI supporting specialists at the edge
of the organisation to support innovation as well as business models that may
exist in this new space.

It was definitely great to be part of this discussion with other thinkers in
the space - we could have gone for many hours but managed to keep it short.

The podcast was hosted by [Michaela Ferreira](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaela-ferreira-183703249/)
and my discussion partners were [Hemil Deshmukh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hemildeshmukh/),
[Gus Gollings](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gusgollings/) and
[David Jenkins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidjenkinshk/).
