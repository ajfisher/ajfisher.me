Today, ['Jump Start Responsive Design'](http://www.sitepoint.com/store/jump-start-responsive-web-design/)
officially goes on sale. This is the first book I've been an author on and
it was great to work alongside [Craig Sharkie - @twalve](http://github.com/twalve)
on this project over the last 6 months.

The book is squarely aimed at developers and designers who are looking to rapidly
get up to speed on current RWD techniques and just get going with them on their
projects. There's plenty of examples that show the current state of where things
are at and how things will also work as browser support increases over time.

It was a pleasure to work on this project with Craig as well as the whole team
over at SitePoint. The dead tree version and eBook are available through SitePoint
as well as all the other usual sellers.
