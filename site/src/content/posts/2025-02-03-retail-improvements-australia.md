Anyone working in retail in Australia (or globally) will tell you it has been a
very hard slog. The combination of slow growth into the pandemic, followed by
[supply chain
issues](https://www.ey.com/en_au/insights/supply-chain/how-covid-19-impacted-supply-chains-and-what-comes-next),
[interest rate hikes](https://tradingeconomics.com/australia/interest-rate)
then rapid inflation has meant discretionary retail has been in troubled waters
for a little while now.

This week, [the ABS released its December 2024 retail spending
report](https://www.abs.gov.au/media-centre/media-releases/retail-spending-steady-december),
and while I doubt CFOs will be unlocking their budgets just yet, it does
show that thereâ€™s the chance weâ€™ve turned the corner in Australia.

Itâ€™s not all unbridled optimism though. If a large-scale trade war erupts -
especially due to US tariff policies and Chinaâ€™s reaction - the modest growth
weâ€™re seeing here could easily wither over the coming quarters.

## Signs of growth - if you know where to look

Overall, retail had the strongest December quarter it has had in years. At
best, accounting for inflation, itâ€™s been flat - and the reality is itâ€™s
probably been down once you take that into account.

While December specifically was down month-on-month by a very slim 0.1%, this
was off the back of strong gains in October (+0.5%) and November (+0.7%).

Consumers are beginning to feel more confident about the economy and a lot of
this is them just knowing where they stand financially. If your rent or
mortgage keeps going up every other month and the prices you pay at the
checkout keep changing, it is incredibly hard to plan your expenditure. As a
result, people stopped spending.

To an extent, this was exactly the RBAâ€™s plan - to cool the economy and curb
inflation. I wonâ€™t pass judgement on how they did that, other than to say for
the last 24 months, consumer spending has been low and discretionary spending
has been severely curtailed.

For retail, this has had huge implications with many stores closing and has
been particularly hard on [restaurants and cafes who have seen record
failures](https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/food/restaurants-bars/there-lies-the-problem-cafes-restaurants-failing-at-fastest-rate-on-record/news-story/d2267f48e9692f8d870cae9ba541d534). 

These latest figures indicate that consumers have finally got a read on their
finances. Inflation is back within target band for most items, and mortgage and
rental rates have largely stabilised (even if they are costing more of a
fraction of income than any time before). Additionally, many consumers have had
a pay rise over the last 18 months.

Most consumers arenâ€™t exactly flush with cash, but the economic landscape is
much more stable than before, fostering confidence and a slight loosening of
the purse strings. This means some additional discretionary spend.

The data shows household goods and department store sales are up while clothing
and cafes are down.

This makes sense - if you are going out less then you are likely at home more,
so you want your home space to be a bit more comfortable. A knock on
implication of this is that you need fewer clothes. We know the op-shops are
[doing very good trade

the last 12 months as a result of people not buying new. We also know that
[Temu and Shein are proving
unstoppable](https://www.roymorgan.com/findings/9646-shein-and-temu-contintue-to-grow-strongly-august-2024)
for cheap fashion and homewares - none of which is really captured in the ABS
numbers for retail spending.

Retail spending increased +0.5% per capita over the quarter which is the first
uptick in more than 2 years - a good sign of sustainable consumer confidence.

## Pulling sales forward

Sales are moving from December and into November (or even earlier) - a trend
thatâ€™s been building for nearly a decade and is becoming more prominent than
ever. The impact of BFCM, Singles Day and Click Frenzy is pushing November
sales higher, away from December being the retail peak.

Working with all my retail clients coming into the end of the year, this
behaviour was easily apparent and is very much in line with the long term
trend.

This has implications for supply chains, seasonal drops and profitability over
the quarter and Iâ€™m not sure any retailers have fully worked through all the
implications of this now just being how consumers behave. In 2025 and 2026 I
believe weâ€™ll see less blanket discounting with better targeting but also more
selectivity when it comes seasonal and new products than weâ€™ve so far.

## Where to from here?

Consumers have told the retail sector that they are prepared to spend again -
but you have to have a good product at a good price. Many buyers are being
extremely picky about their spending and are quite happy to wait until a sale
comes around so they can get a discount and keep hold of their hard-won
discretionary dollars.

There is a great deal of variance across localities, verticals and audiences so
understanding exposure to this is imperative for retail leaders to manage risk
but also understand where the opportunities fall. Targeting of audiences from
both an acquisition and retention standpoint is going to be key here -
especially if you can frame additional benefit beyond price parity. Unlocking
initiatives that help enable this would be good investments of human and
financial capital.

The last few years have been some of the most difficult Iâ€™ve seen in retail for
my entire career - reflective of it being a difficult period of time for
consumers. That said, the numbers for the December quarter are the most
positive they have been across the retail sector since the start of the
pandemic - multiple indicators suggest that while we arenâ€™t out of retail
winter just yet, we might be entering a thaw and there are a few patches of new
growth that indicate spring may be on the way.
