Over the last few years, JavaScript has been developing much more rapidly and
we are starting to see it move well out of the browser. Most people assume
this just means running server side as [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) however
we're also starting to see it run in physical environments as well.

Recently I was lucky enough to be invited to travel to Bangalore, India
by the wonderful people at [HasGeek](https://hasgeek.com/) to participate in
[JSFoo 15](https://jsfoo.in/2015/). This was a fantastic opportunity to talk
not just about NodeBots but how web connected hardware is where a lot of
development will be taking place over the coming decade and how web developers
in particular have useful skills to bring to bear in the hardware world.

The talk was on Droids, JavaScript & Web Connected hardware, the video is below:

Alongside my talk was a hardware workshop and I also wrote an article for
HasGeek detailing some of this transition we're starting to see.

Over the last few years I have watched this community evolve from a group of
people sharing some code on GitHub and some pics on twitter to a truly global
movement where thousands of developers and designers have built real-world
physical things controlled with JavaScript. <b>Web developers in particular
love to make things but we tend to focus on the digital</b>. Even our language
speaks to this, where we talk about code as a "craft" as much as engineering
and we "build" a site. It's this aptitude and interest in building that is
one of the key elements in why NodeBots and JS hardware is taking off. I
have watched the satisfaction of someone who's only experience of hardware
is putting batteries into an object build a sensor that determines if the
the coffee machine is free or in use.
