It seems like hardware and JavaScript has really hit a tipping point this year
with numerous workshops and nodebots events taking place all around the world.
I was invited to do a workshop as part of the [DDD Conference](http://www.dddmelbourne.com/)
this year. Given the other IoT leaning discussion sessions, I felt that instead
of building robots, we'd focus on a much more practical IoT session, getting
participants to learn some basic electronics and then build some very simple
IoT devices.

The workshop presentation is below. The code used for the workshop is
[available in a github repo](https://github.com/ajfisher/jsiot-workshop). The
devices that were built were:

* Simple blinking an LED
* Gmail notifier
* twitter keyword blinker
* Weather forecast
* Ambient light visualisation
* Temperature data logger
