In the news recently has been the whole thing about not only the copy
protection on [HD-DVD and Blu-Ray disks being
cracked](http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/12/29/HNdrmhacked_1.html) but
people posting digg links with decryption keys in them. I can understand Digg's
position in removing said posts until the community kicked off and [they then
decided they'll go down with the ship ](http://blog.digg.com/?p=74)if they got
prosecuted. Hurrah for someone over there seeing sense.

One part of my brain always goes "Hooray for the hackers" whenever we hear
stories about DRM being hacked in whatever guise it has been created. Another
part of my brain, probably the more rational side I guess, does kick in
afterwards and say that putting these things out in the wild will enable more
software / media piracy and will incur costs for the companies that produce it
which will make them either raise costs or step up counter-piracy methods. I
never get to the "woe is me" stage like most media company execs do as they are
truly multi-billion dollar organisations so it's hardly going to come out of
the mail boy's pay cheque and they are unlikely to go bust.

What I do question properly though is the rationale that got us here in the
first place. Since the 60s with tape-to-tape reels starting to replace vinyl
records, music, film and software piracy has got bigger and bigger. What has
happened though is nothing short of an arms race. Consistent through this
entire arms race have been three key points:

1. That me, or anyone else, once they have bought a product has the right to
   play or use it for their own personal enjoyment whenever they see fit. This
   is the argument that most consumers will use - I might buy a CD album but I
   want to play it on my MP3 player. I might buy a DVD but I want to play it on
   my Linux laptop as well as on my TV.

2. Companies that produce consumable media assume that anyone that wants to
   copy a product is inherently up to no good and they are now labelled as
   pirates and are probably taking the music / film / software and selling it
   in backstreet market stalls.

3. The profligacy of piracy is directly related to the first two points and how
   policed piracy is within the community.

One can directly see that paid for knock off copies of movies and music is
completely against the law as you are selling someone's work and is tantamount
to counterfeiting. However, a framework for dealing with these people exists
within the law and we are starting to see this go down.

The media companies will tell you that it's because of their anti-copy
protection, however in reality it is because of better policing and it being
viewed as a black market operation and it having been historically a move
away from "hard crimes" that has occured over the last 20 years.

This argument doesn't wash at all with consumers. Once I purchase a peice of
media it is mine to use how I want on whatever device I choose.

The barriers that are being put up by the media companies in their zero
tolerance to consumers is assuring their position as the "big bad ogre" in all
of this. Were they to engage with the consumers who are most likely to want to
move content from one form to another they would probably be able to reach a
solution.

Indeed were they to strip all DRM from their content altogether and then spend
the money on producing better content or else supporting better policing they
would probably turn a larger profit.

In the words of Nixon, "I am not a crook" - but I do want to watch Spiderman 3
when it comes out possibly on my TV from my XBOX, on my Linux Laptop, Windows
Media centre and my PDA. At the moment I'll be lucky if one of those four work
so I probably won't buy it at all.
