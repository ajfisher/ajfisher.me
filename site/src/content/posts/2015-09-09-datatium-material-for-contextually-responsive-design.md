    Responsive design is still very screen size focussed where as we should be
    considering context much more than we do. This talk explains how Datatium
    helps resolve this.

A large focus of my work at [JBA](jbadigital.com) is UX related data science
and in particular how useful understanding of what someone is doing can be used
to create a better experience for them. Whilst most of this is oriented to
online experiences, the application of this applies to any experience really.

The main aspect of this I work on (which even applies to my IoT work) is to
better understand context - how an experience can be shaped based in information
about the current context someone is in. This is immediately applicable to
our current responsive design trends as it's not sufficient to simply respond
to someone's screen size when there are night and day differences in things like
network speed for example.

I was asked to talk about this topic at [Be Responsive](http://beresponsive.io)
to highlight how responsive design needs to move past the current fixation on
screen sizes (though we have thankfully moved on from simply pixel sizes) and
truly understand context first in order to be able to create good responsive
experiences.
