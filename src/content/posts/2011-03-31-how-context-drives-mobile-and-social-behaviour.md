Our retail behaviour is a function of context and specifically whether I am in the right contextual mode to shop. Too often context is neglected when talking about mobile and social strategy in the retail sector - which assumes that just because I'm using my phone or engaging on facebook it means I want to purchase.




This short presentation explores how context shapes behaviour and specifically talks about how address each of these contexts in a retail scenario.
