So what with a relocation from London to Melbourne to take on the Technical Directorship of one of Australia's leading digital agencies and all that entails, keeping this blog up to date has been kind of problematic, especially with the lazy-man's alternative being Twitter and a corporate blog that I contribute to as well.

I've reassessed this blog though and it's going to be taking a slight departure but hopefully should be all the more useful because of that.
