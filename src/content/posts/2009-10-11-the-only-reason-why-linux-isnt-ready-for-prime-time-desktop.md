Okay, so this title's probably a bit misleading as there are probably a few reasons but as far as I'm concerned there's only one thing stopping my final transition to desktop Linux for complete every day usage.

Presenting

In my job I do a lot of presenting. I give major milestone presentations on projects, I present to the business on things that are going on, I present in pitches where we are attempting to win new business and recently I've started presenting at conferences.

I would not use my Linux desktop (and I have combinations of [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntulinux.com/) and KUbuntu 9.04, CentOS) to present with at all - even if someone paid me.

Before I say why I'll also lay out my Linux credentials. I use RHEL, Ubuntu and Centos EVERY day. All of my home computers are Linux based, I have a Linux PDA, I prefer my Ubuntu desktop for work and I administer numerous Linux (CentOS and RHEL) servers - via command line - all of the time. I've used it for over a decade and am more than happy with it and more than happy to hack on it to get stuff working.

However, there comes a point where I am not going to entrust a complete presentation that our business or my reputation relies upon to Linux's extremely flaky graphics system.

Yes, I know laptop Linux is problematic (but if the rest of the desktop is stable why not my second video out?)

Yes, I know that graphics card support (particularly from ATI) is very closed so there's lots of reverse engineering going on (but again if I can have one video out working why not two?).

I'm not sure why this is the case - I think it's a combination of X.org config and poor tools for configuring multiple screens with different resolutions but it definitely needs a lot of work to go ready for prime time.

I was at a [conference this week](http://south.webdirections.org/) and I had built [my entire presentation](http://technologytreason.blogspot.com/2009/10/web-directions-south-2009-cloud.html) in my Gnome desktop using FLOSS tools like [Open Office Impress](http://www.openoffice.org/), had a great looking presentation and was legitimately keen on presenting using either my Ubuntu or Centos desktop. After hours of mucking around however I didn't feel supremely confident in just walking up to the podium, plugging in my laptop and "It Just Works"TM. It's just too hit and miss.

I don't generally experience this with Linux in general and Ubuntu specifically although I am aware of other people saying it. For me 99% of the time it does actually just work.

So I defaulted back to my dual-boot Windows partition and presented from that instead. This was the partition that I had considered nuking because I hadn't used it in about 6 months. In this instance though I didn't have any other choice - and sure enough it did just plug in and go.

I still presented from Open Office Impress though (which is a fantastic bit of software I might add!) and I think I was the only one at WDS09 that presented with it (and I'm sure no one could tell I wasn't using PowerPoint or Keynote).

Desktop experience is exactly that - an experience and our experience, particularly when we are doing something social with a computer can affect our mental state quite substantially.

If I'd have taken the decision to present using Ubuntu I would have felt worried about whether my laptop would work and I would have been nervous and probably would have delivered a terrible presentation. In contrast because I knew I wasn't going to have any support issues I felt confident, in control and delivered what I hope was a good presentation to the audience.

Ubuntu are trying to address many of these issues with the [Paper Cuts project](https://launchpad.net/hundredpapercuts) but that's really aimed at business. Apple have addressed similar issues (hardware compatibility) by having a presenter's kit (which you buy) which provides all kinds of adapters to go from Mac to just about every video input type. Microsoft addressed this years ago from Windows 2000 with a great set of dual head tools that made it simple and a standardised way for vendors to incorporate them and it is extremely rare for it to fail.

Business use is one of the areas that Linux (and especially Ubuntu) has got a real opportunity to shif users across as there are so many other business benefits but users want a single consistent desktop so they aren't going to build on one desktop and present on another - it's too inconsistent.

For me this issue on presenting and graphics support isn't so much a paper cut as it is a gaping flesh wound and it really needs to be addressed.
